# ConsoleDesigner

A very fist version of simple console designer. Use mouse to draw.
Requirements:
Windows >= XP and Windows < Win8.
Screen resolution >= 1366 x 768.
(1024 x 768 still OK, but you may need to resize the canvas to be smaller).

# About changing ASCII (prompt after pressing F6):
Use \<Ascii code><Enter> to change to special code. E.g: \6<Enter> or \102<Enter>

# Considering doing in future:
* "Fill" the canvas with background.
